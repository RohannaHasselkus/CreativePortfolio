<!-- MAIN CONTENT -->
<section class="intro-text">
  <p>My work explores the complexities of the human experience through surreal figuration and symbolic imagery. I use the body as a vessel to express inner states, presenting it not only as a physical form but also through fragmented forms and layered textures that suggest the instability of identity. Recurring motifs such as flowers or mirrored silhouettes embody the constant interplay between vulnerability and strength while also alluring to complex social themes. These elements work together to form a visual language that reflects both the fragility and resilience of existence.
<br>
I am interested in the idea of escapism and how it operates within artistic practice. Escapism often carries connotations of avoidance, yet in art it becomes a paradox, for even as we escape, we inevitably reveal the very structures from which we seek release. This duality is at the core of my work. Every act of departure from reality carries with it a return, every attempt at concealment simultaneously discloses something deeper. Escapism is therefore not a negation of the world but a reconfiguration of it, a process in which imagination makes visible what remains unspoken in daily life.
<br>
The notion that art is bound by societal constructs is one I continually wrestle with. On the surface, it might appear dismal to suggest that our expressions are shaped and limited by external forces. Yet I view this influence as a point of departure rather than an endpoint. Although our creative impulses are inevitably informed by the experiences and environments we inhabit, we are not defined entirely by them. Through the act of making, we transform what we have inherited. In this way, art becomes both an echo of the world and an alternative to it.
<br>
My practice embraces this contradiction, allowing the work to exist in a liminal space between reflection and reinvention. In exploring the tension between vulnerability and strength, reality and escape, I aim to create images that speak to the universality of human experience while leaving space for individual interpretation. Ultimately, my work reflects a belief that even within the confines of social and cultural structures, we possess the ability to reshape meaning and to envision possibilities beyond what is immediately given.</p>
